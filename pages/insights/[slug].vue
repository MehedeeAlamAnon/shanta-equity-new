          How the dollar crisis is increasing burden for international students

          Despite the enormous disparity in university expenses across the
          globe, American tuition notoriously stands out as the most expensive.
          Even with hefty financial aid and scholarships, being able to afford a
          US education is a dream only a select few in Bangladesh can achieve.
          However, the dream for international students just got costlier as the
          US Dollar rose to a record high in two decades.

        <p class="text-18px leading-30px text-justify mt-69px">
          At the time of writing this article, the USD to BDT exchange rate
          stands at USD 1 amounting to BDT 95.06 on the interbank foreign
          exchange platform. While many students are forced to reevaluate their
          decision to pursue their higher education in the Land of
          Opportunities, the scenario is grimmer for the ones who had already
          taken the leap.

        <p class="text-18px leading-30px text-justify mt-69px">
          "Tuition has increased significantly in terms of BDT. By the time my
          parents manage to burn holes in their pockets to send what they can,
          registration for classes already begins. I can barely get any of my
          major classes since they fill up very fast. I work here so I managed
          to save up some money, but I had to use it all to pay the remainder of
          my tuition, leaving me financially strapped." shared Abedur Rahman, an
          undergraduate student at Penn State University.
        </p>
        <p class="text-18px leading-30px text-justify mt-69px">
          Another student studying in the US, Fahad Sabit* said, "My parents
          earn money in BDT, not USD. As the dollar rate rises, it is getting
          increasingly difficult to afford my education. With half of my degree
          still left, it is a major cause for concern."
        </p>
        <p class="text-18px leading-30px text-justify mt-69px">
          The appreciation of the US Dollar has sent currencies depreciating all
          around the world and cast doubt on the future of the global economy by
          upending everything from the price of international travel to the
          success of multinational corporations.
        </p>
        <p class="text-18px leading-30px text-justify mt-69px">
          Unfortunately, this is not a "one size fits all" type of scenario. The
          appreciation of the US Dollar has had diverse effects and implications
          on international students depending on their personal budgets, needs,
          economic solvency, and their sources of income. Their future plans and
          how they hope to earn back the amount they invest in their education
          also have an effect.
        </p>
        <p class="text-18px leading-30px text-justify mt-69px">
          "By the middle of 2022, I began struggling to maintain the budget I
          had set for myself earlier this year after moving to the UK. My
          part-time job initially helped in covering up my extra expenses such
          as occasionally traveling and eating out, but I gradually found myself
          struggling to keep money aside for recreation as my grocery took up a
          lot of it. When the exchange rate and my tuition fees went up
          simultaneously, the minimum wage I was earning was not enough and this
          put a strain on my parents who bear the brunt of my tuition fees and
          have another child to support." shares Samin Sabah Islam, who is
          currently studying at the University of Warwick.
        </p>
        <p class="text-18px leading-30px text-justify mt-69px">
          International students are being forced to compromise on parts of
          their lives they used to take for granted before moving abroad. Ohona
          Rahman*, a student at the University of Alberta shares, "On a personal
          level, the ongoing inflation has made an impact on my daily expenses
          like groceries, eating out, phone plans, etc. This entails sometimes
          having to travel greater distances just to get my shopping done, just
          because a certain store has slightly lower prices than the supermarket
          near home."
        </p>
        <p class="text-18px leading-30px text-justify mt-69px">
          Other than the more visible strain of giving up on certain luxuries in
          order to afford the primary costs of living and studying abroad,
          international students are also suffering from great mental and
          emotional stress.
        </p>
        <p class="text-18px leading-30px text-justify mt-69px">
          "My mental health has been on a downward spiral lately as I constantly
          have to think about how to keep up with the rising rates and this
          leaves me with less freedom to do the things I would like to do,"
          laments Ramisa Mustafa, a student at York University.
        </p>
        <p class="text-18px leading-30px text-justify mt-69px">
          While the situation seems grim with little to no possibilities of
          relief on the horizon, many students are still trying to find ways and
          make ends meet to achieve their dreams of studying abroad, even at a
          much higher cost.
